Hobbies ....well  I am an amateur thespian, being quite heavily involved with my local community theatre group on stage and directing. So also love to go to the theatre in Edinburgh. I love sketching and painting, and enjoy my horses and showing sheep in summer. So quite varied interests. But together my husband and I love to ski and travel, and have had the privilege of visiting some fascinating destinations and people. Not ones for just sitting on beaches though we like to tour about a bit and get to know the countries we visit.  Ski destinations aside, which have been largely the European high altitude resorts, some of our favourites include, Zambia, Kenya, Egypt, Zanzibar, Cuba, Mauritius, the Bahamas and Jordan. Southern hemisphere is making it's way up our list. I have taken in a couple of interesting city breaks with my son including Manhattan and Istanbul in more recent years. My favourite films are very varied and include, Dangerous Liaisons, Elizabeth, The Duchess, A few good men, GI Jane, Double jeopardy, A Beautiful mind, Shawshank Redemption and Avatar, along with all the Harry Potter films! to name but a few. And I confess to being a fan of the recent TV series Game of Thrones. \r\nThe flat was bought with my son in mind as he attends Edinburgh University, so it is let out during summer and more particularly the Festival period before the academic year starts back in September. That said it is a good step up from usual student accommodation and is a great wee flat, furnishings and decor are more basic than a full time home, but very clean, warm, everything you could need is in the flat  and it is such a great location.",

		"neighborhood_overview": "Hornsey is a lovely green and tree-filled area, with its own little river running right next to our flat, home to lots of birds and popular with dog walkers. There are lots of independent cafes and delis in the area, and in nearby Crouch End and Muswell Hill, with a friendly and creative vibe about the place. New River Village is home to lots of young professionals, some students, and some young families, and has a welcoming and friendly atmosphere. Our flat is around 15 minutes walk from Alexandra Palace, which is a great walk on a dry day - and means we're perfectly situated for gigs at Ally Pally.",
		"notes": "We have a cleaner, Helen, who visits once every two weeks - she's part of the family really! We love her to bits. If she's scheduled to come while you're staying with us, we're happy to make arrangements that work for everyone. Please note: our flat is not in central London, but in a leafy, greener area in Zone 3. It is around 5 minutes walk to the local station, from where you can get a train that will take you in to Central London in 10 to 15 minutes.",
		"transit": "Hornsey is really well connected - we have an overground train line taking you right into the City (perfect for central London) and East London (perfect for socalising!) and a nearby tube station on the Piccadilly line, which will get you into Covent Garden in around 35 minutes, door-to-door. We're easily reached from Kings Cross and Euston train stations, as well as Luton and Stansted airports (by train) and Heathrow airport (Piccadilly line).",
		"access": "The double bedroom is all yours. We have our own en-suite bathroom, so the main bathroom (shown in the photos) is yours to use too. The kitchen is quite small, and you're welcome to use it to make breakfast; there are lots of local restaurants, delis and cafes for you to find dinner.",
		"interaction": "We love our area, and London more widely, and will happily make recommendations of places to visit (and the best way to get there), and where to eat, and drink.  As we are renting a room in our home, we expect we'll be around; we both work full-time during the day, and are pretty active in the evenings at weekends, which means there should be plenty of space for everyone :)",
		"house_rules": "As we both work full-time during the week, as do many of our neighbours, we try to keep the noise down between midnight and 7am. Because the kitchen is small, we need to keep it clean and tidy, though we're not obsessive about it.",

		"neighborhood_overview": "Airbnb has a good look and feel of the neighbourhood at  https://www.airbnb.com/locations/london/whitechapel-brick-lane I moved to this location because London is always changing and I like to go with the trends and the flow. For the last twenty years the big things have been inner city living, the rise of East London and particularly Hoxton, Shoreditch and Bricklane. When I moved back after a decade in New York this seemed to be the place to be. I love that it is easy to get to so many things on foot, by bike or by public transport. It is also a very multicultural area which for me is a  plus - but be aware the area is 40% muslim. It is also \"real\" London. There is a little grit to the local area - You get a view of historic London but that includes the fact that this is the dirt poor area of London sandwiched between the two big financial centres. It is changing incredibly fast with bankers, students, artist and fashion people move in while the traditional Bangladeshi people still he",
		"notes": "The only negative comments I have had is about the area and that it is very Arab. It is not - it is the centre for the Bangladeshi community. They are muslim and proud of it but I think the are a well settle and integrated community -  less alienated than other muslim communities in Europe. I get on well with several of the shopkeepers.",
		"transit": "The public transport is excellent and a key reason I picked the apartment. You can get a bus to the centre of town from the end of the street, 2 minutes walk away. The Tube zone 1 is less than 10 minutes walk. DLR 5 minutes away. You can even walk 15 minutes to the tower of London and take the riverboat. There are several stations for the bike hire system closeby.",
		"access": "You can use everything you would expect to in a modern apartment. Unlimited wifi. You are free to use the kitchen to cook breakfast, lunch or dinner as you choose. You have half the fridge, use of the coffee machine, dishwasher and washer/dryer if you need it.",
		"interaction": "I have had a lot of guests over the last two years and it has been an immensely positive thing for me and also I hope for the guests.  However, guests vary enormously. Some people want to see lots of things in London or friends they already have; they are just interested in a convenient bedroom and I see very little of them. For others I have spent really good times chatting, going out to restaurants and bars and really getting to know them. There has even been a start up born in the apartment. I am happy to have a variety of people with different reasons to stay and all are welcome. I am relaxed and happy to interact as much or as little as the guests want. I often work from home so I am around and happy to chat and answer questions. If I am really busy and need quiet to concentrate I use the local library so don't worry about disturbing me.",
		"house_rules": "The main rules are friendliness and politeness.  Nothing too crazy Sunday through Thursday. There is a maid who comes in once a week and cleans everything - please be nice and cooperate with her. Wifi is free to use, just ask for the login and password. Feel free to use the kitchen and any of the facilities. I am always happy to help on questions about London, getting around etc.  I am normally up for the odd beer or a curry (we are in the centre of the universe for curry)",

		"neighborhood_overview": "Islington is a wonderfully eclectic blend of cool and established, young and old, long-time residents and newcomers. You can look at the AIRBNB neighbourhood guide for more details. Our flat is on a quiet tree-lined residential street just off Newington Green (North Islington). It's fairly central/urban, but the street is also very friendly - we know most of our neighbours.  Newington Green itself is a great mix of gentrified (i.e. trendy, expensive) and old school (betting shops, pound shops). Minutes from the flat you'll find a great greengrocer, a fish and chip shop, late-opening corner shops, fab cheap Turkish restaurants, plus cafes and pubs. We've marked many of these on our tailor-made online airbnb guidebook, a printout of which you'll find in the flat. Newly uber-trendy Dalston and the more established somewhat hippy chick/ yummy mummy Stoke Newington are within walking distance, as is Islington's famous Upper Street, and getting to central London is easy by bus or tube.",
		"notes": "Please fill in your profile and post a photo before submitting a reservation or making an enquiry. No third party bookings please - if you're booking you need to be the person staying here, it's an AIRBNB requirement. We offer flexible check in and check out but please consult us before booking travel which will mean you arrive early (before 11am) or late (after 8pm). Same applies for a late check out (after midday) though usually that's not a problem - you can leave your bags and collect them later or even stay in the flat if we aren't back until late ourselves.  Please note we allow smoking in the (very well-aired) flat so if you are sensitive to any lingering trace of cigarette smoke, you may prefer somewhere else.",
		"transit": "The nearest tube station is Canonbury (6 - 8 mins walk), on the fast and frequent London Overground. Canonbury to Camden Road (for Camden Market) is 7 mins; Hampstead Heath, a glorious huge park, is about 20 mins away; Shoreditch High Street (for Brick Lane) is 9 mins. Oxford Circus is 20 mins away, with one change at Highbury & Islington. The Olympic Park and Westfield - a huge shopping mall at Stratford - are 15 minutes away, again on the Overground. South Kensington Tube Station - for the V & A, Natural History Museum, Science Museum and Hyde Park - is approx 30 mins by Overground and tube. Local buses serve the City & London Bridge, Waterloo & the South Bank, Soho, Piccadilly, Victoria and Oxford Street to name but a few. We provide tube maps, general transport info, hand-drawn maps of the local area and fold-out pocket maps of London in the AIRBNB drawer in our flat to help you find your way around easily. If you want advice on where to go/how to get there, don't hesitate to ask u",

On check out you simply lock up, put the keys in the padded envelope provided and pop them through the letterbox. We are available by mobile during your time with us to answer any questions or solve any problems that may arise.",

We only have a few specific rules as follows: No smoking in the bedroom No visitors except by prior arrangement No loud music after 11pm Nothing to be left in the communal hallway Please make sure the main front door is locked at all times Otherwise make yourselves at home and have a very lovely time :)",

We've enjoyed meeting some great hosts too. We are super tidy, reliable and considerate of other people's places.\r\n\r\nWe are now hosting as we want to get away more often and it makes sense not to leave the flat empty. Since we started hosting we have welcomed guests from all over the world - Spain, Germany, Switzerland, Denmark, France, Italy, the US and Australia - as well as from all over the UK\r\n\r\nWhat do we particularly love about hosting?

My husband and I love to travel - it's a great escape and our favourite cities include Sydney and Istanbul. Other favourite places include Indonesia and Cape Range National Park, Australia - a great place for camping and a complete escape from shops (and mobile signals!)",

There are a number of parks nearby, including Finsbury Park (w/ boating lake), Clissold Park (w/ children's zoo) and the newly opened Woodberry Wetlands (gorgeous wildlife haven). Green Lanes itself is famous for its Turkish restaurants - honestly, you won't taste better ocakbasi this side of Istanbul - and they're all v. inexpensive and popular w/ families. There are also plenty of cool coffee places etc and for a cook, the Turkish/Indian/Italian/East European grocers and proper English butcher are second to none (I'll give you my specific tips).",

And there are three nearby stations. * Manor House is a ten minute walk/two minute bus away. It's on the Piccadilly Line, so you can get to central London in about 20 minutes. * Harringay is a five minute walk away. It's on the overground. Trains go to King's Cross (for Eurostar etc) and to Moorgate (via Islington and Shoreditch). In the other direction, it goes to Enfield and Hertford. * Harringay Green Lanes is a two-minute walk away. Trains go to Gospel Oak (which gives you really easy access to the wilds of Hampstead Heath)",

The flat has wooden floors, and because of that, although I have put rugs on the floor to minimise the noise going through to the flat downstairs, I ask for the shoes to be removed whilst in the flat in order not to disturb my neighbours downstairs. I would overall ask all guests to be considerate of the neighbours and refrain from making too much noise at night. Guests are welcome to use all facilities in the flat, including the washing machine and the dishwasher, as well as the fiber-optic broadband internet connection. There is no TV in the flat. It gets very good light through the day. The double bed in the bedroom can sleep two, and two more people may sleep using the sofa-bed in the living",

Notice that if you will be more than 3 people sharing the flat and use the sofa bed, that the sofa-bed has a mat that measures 120cm by 200cm and is not as thick as the mattress I have on the bed. Two people have slept quite a few times using that sofabed, although note that it is around 20cm-30cm shorter than how wide a normal double/queen sized bed would be. I would like you to confirm this before proceeding with the booking. I am quite flexible with check-in and check-out times, but we may have to coordinate with other guests that might be checking out/in the dates you are checking in/out.",

Apart from those serious things, I've been very involved in putting on the London Latin American Film Festival - I love film and in other kinds of event organisation.  I will continue to take guests at my London home and also offer it in exchange for accommodation elsewhere. So far my favourite places in the world are Costa Rica, Zanzibar, Istanbul, Havana, Sicily and London of course!",

Heathrow's Piccadilly line is direct to Caledonian Road which is our nearest tube station. Hampstead Heath is only 10mins away on the train. In this location the transport services are excellent",

It has a 30-something feel to it, independent fashion and stationary shops, pubs and yoga, cafes with wifi. Fashionable freelancers working in coffee shops, couples having dinners in the excellent restaurants and young families enjoying a walk in Clissold Park. In the evening, when coffee shops and Whole Foods is closing, Church Street shows its 'night side' with international cuisine, pubs, live music at Ryan's Bar and DJ sets until the early morning in the Club underneath The Three Crowns Pub. Walking South south along Stoke Newington High Street you will find a row of Turkish restaurants, more excellent cocktail bars, and infamous clubs like The Nest and Shacklewell Arms. For quiet strolls go towards Abney Cementary, Clissold Park and Finsbury Park or take a walk along the Lea River to the east.",

It runs frequently depending on the time of the day, every 5-15 minutes, day and night, 24 hrs, every day. During rush hours (weekdays 8-10 am and 5-7pm) I would recommend Overground (Stoke Newington Station, 5 minute walk) or the Underground from Finsbury Park (10 mins by bus route 206) - Victoria Line or Piccadilly Line.",

Angel has buses going in every direction you would like to go. It is so central you won't be struggling for options. There are hire bikes (\"Boris bikes\") just down the street, you pay by the day (\u00a32) so if you're making a lot of short journeys, they're the cheapest way to get around (and you'll get to see a lot more of the city on a bike (or bus) than you will in the tube). If you want a taxi, we recommend using Uber. If you download the Uber app, and enter the code andreas1209, you'll automatically get your first ride for free (up to \u00a310). London black cabs are great, all the drivers have to know every single street in the city to get their license, but they're a lot more expensive.",

From my flat you can walk to many famous attractions including Tower Bridge, the Tower of London, the Shard, the Globe, the Tate Modern and the Design Museum. There are also lots of smaller quirky attractions such as the Fashion and Textiles Museum, the Brunel Museum and the Old Operating Theater Museum.   The area is a foodies paradise and on Saturday and Sunday just 5 mins walk is Maltby Street food market and 15 mins walk to Borough Market. Bermondsey Street is full of great and award winning restaurants such as Zucca and Pizzaro. There are also lots of great little independent shops, bars and cafes and a real neighborhood feel.",
		"notes": "I am a yoga teacher and Thai massage therapist so if you are feeling travel weary you can arrange a 1-2-1 yoga class or massage by prior appointment. You would also be welcome to attend one of my local public classes.",
		"transit": "My home has great public transport links with the nearest underground stations being London Bridge and Borough and I provide guest Oyster cards and maps to make getting around really easy. My home is also served by quite a few bus routes including the 188 which goes directly to the Waterloo, Southbank and the British Museum, the 42 which goes to Liverpool Street Station and Shoreditch,  and the C10 for the Houses of Parliament and Victoria Station.  If you are coming into London Gatwick or Luton there are direct trains to London Bridge and from Standsted the quickest and cheapest route is to take the national express coach to Stratford and then the Jubilee line to London Bridge. If you would like to drive there is free parking at weekends and paid for parking in the week just outside my home.",
		"access": "You are welcome to use the rest of the flat including the living room (which also has a sofa bed that can accommodate another two guests), the balcony, bathroom (including big bath for relaxing in) and spacious kitchen with breakfast bar.",
		"interaction": "I am a friendly host and being a born and bred Londoner I can advise on lots of local things to do, best restaurants, galleries, local walks etc. and am happy to chat and have a coffee with you. However, if you\u2019d prefer your privacy I will also respect that. I teach on quite a few evenings a week so often you\u2019ll have the place to yourself.",
		"house_rules": "I welcome open and friendly guests. I request that you take your shoes off in my home but have comfortable slippers you can borrow to wear around the apartment.  You can make yourself a fresh ground coffee, and I have a selection of herbal teas and are welcome to cook. I have fresh growing herbs, spices and condiments which you can use.  I am a vegetarian so don't allow cooking of meat, but if you would like to keep cold meat for sandwiches and snacks in the fridge that would be fine.   The flat has recycling and I request guests use this facility and turn lights off when they go out as I am eco conscious. My home is a peaceful haven from the hustle and bustle of city life and I would expect guest to treat it accordingly. If you smoke you are welcome to do so on the balcony.",

		"host_about": "Hello, I'm Tania. \r\n\r\nI have been blessed in life to have a lovely home in central London and love sharing it with like minded travelers. I'm half Indian but was raised in central London and love the both the vibrancy and diversity of this city, but also the beauty of the landscapes, parks and buildings. \r\n\r\nI love to travel and have visited India, South East Asia, Australia, New Zealand, North America, Peru and Brazil - to name a few! I recently stayed with lovely hosts in Berlin and Istanbul and now would think twice about staying in a hotel!. \r\n\r\nI believe life is about the personal connections we make with people, our friends and families, and the laughter and knowledge we share. I'm lucky to have friends all over the world and have already had many guests from countries such as America, New Zealand, Mexico and the Netherlands. \r\n\r\nI work in the environment field part time but also teach yoga and practice Thai massage. I teach locally and enjoy being part of the Bermondsey community. \r\n\r\nWhen I'm at home I like reading and writing about yoga, lounging in the hammock, listening to music, art, relaxing, cooking and planning my next adventure. I come from a big family and I really like to share so would be happy to cook a delicious healthy vegetarian meal for you if I'm around. I have two vintage tea sets, and also like to have tea and cake sometimes (very English). There is a local antiques market on Fridays that also has a vintage clothes stall if you\u2019d like to pick up your own piece of British history. I have three bikes (including one that you can borrow) and I can advise on local cycling routes - there is also a bike hire scheme nearby. \r\n\r\nHaving grown up in London I have a lot of local knowledge and if you need advice just ask, however if you'd just prefer to get lost and wonder around in this amazing city then that's also alot of fun!\r\n\r\nI look forward to welcoming you to my little Haven in the center of the city, \r\n\r\nTania",

Location is central and within a walk to tube, DLR, overground, bus stops and across the road there is a bike hire station. Kitchen is fully equipped. There is a piano in the lounge!  Wifi, washing machine. I love that I'm within walking distance of Brick Lane and Spitafields market. There is so much going on in East London, it's a vibrant part of town with bags of history. I cycle everywhere from here. I cycle to work in Oxford Circus in twenty minutes. There is plenty of choices when it comes to public transport. The tube at White Chapel. The DLR/Overgournd at Shadwell. Buses across the street that enter Zone 1 within a few stops so that's always an option too. Very centrally located.

Please respect the neighbours, and do not make significant noise or play loud music after 10pm.  No parties.  If guests lock themselves out of the property OR they do not place keys in the lockbox at checkout, a \u00a350 fee will apply. If a guest loses a set of keys during their stay, an \u00a380 fee will apply.   Our general rule is just to leave the flat as you found it. Help yourself to all the cooking equipment in the kitchen, and feel free to read the books on the shelf.   Have fun!",
